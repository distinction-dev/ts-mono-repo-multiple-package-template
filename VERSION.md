# Version Rules
We will follow the standard SemVer format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
The choice of version number to increment depends on the scale and impact of the changes to the entire monorepo.

# Versioning Rules:
1. MAJOR: Increment the MAJOR version when there are breaking changes or significant changes affecting the entire monorepo like addition of new package/ breaking changes.
2. MINOR: Increment the MINOR version when new features or changes are added to the entire monorepo in a backward-compatible manner like new utility functions/ packages addition and refractor (optimization or current).
3. PATCH: Increment the PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes or minor updates to the monorepo like few bug fixes.
